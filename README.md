# Summary:
Predict whether or not a customer will subscribe a term deposit after the marketing campaign the bank performed.

We want to be able to accomplish:
1. How likely a customer will subscribe to a term deposit?
2. Variables selection techniques
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Model creation and selection process.

# Goal:
Create a binary classification model that predicts whether or not a customer will subscribe a term deposit after a marketing campaign the bank performed, based on many indicators. The target variable is given as y and takes on a value of 1 if the customer has subscribed and 0 otherwise.

# Tools:
1. Bayesian Logistic Regression
2. PyMC3
3. Theano
4. Sklearn
